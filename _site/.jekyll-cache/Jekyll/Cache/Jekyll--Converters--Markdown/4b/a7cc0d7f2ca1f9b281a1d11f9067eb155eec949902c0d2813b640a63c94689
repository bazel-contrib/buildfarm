<h2 id="what-is-buildfarm">What is buildfarm?</h2>
<p>Buildfarm is a service software stack which presents an implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis">Remote Execution API</a>. This means it can be used by any client of that API to retain content <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ContentAddressableStorage</code>, cache ActionResults by a key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ActionCache</code>, and execute actions asynchronously <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Execution</code>.</p>

<p>Buildfarm is cross-platform has been heavily tested with bazel as a client.</p>

<p>This documentation is a comprehensive description of the architecture, features, functionality, and operation, as well as a guide to a smoothly installing and running the software. Familiarity with the Remote Execution API is expected, and references to it will be provided as needed.</p>
