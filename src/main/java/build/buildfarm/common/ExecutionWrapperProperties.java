 * @class ExecutionWrapperProperties
 * @brief The correlation of buildfarm features to underlying execution wrappers.
 * @details Buildfarm has the ability to execute actions differently through execution wrappers.
 *     These wrappers could be chosen dynamically from the client or configured via buildfarm. This
 *     data shows the dependency of a feature to the underlying wrapper. It can be used to verify
 *     whether a wrapper is needed for the particular feature. The original intention of this data
 *     is to verify the existence of wrappers on startup to warn about unavailable features.
